Ladies and gentlemen, girls and blokes and non-binary folks:
**This is a rant.**

You should not expect to reason with me, nor expect me to be reasonable.

Having said that, here is a question for you:


`_____`'s roles, artifacts, events, and rules are _immutable_ and
although implementing only parts of `_____` is possible, _the result
is not_ `_____`.

<!-- Note -->
If you were to read this statement not knowing what the blank stands for, think about what it sounds like to you. 

If you're wired like me, it sounds like something out of a radical political manifesto, or maybe an extremely strict religious sect or cult.


`Scrum`'s roles, artifacts, events, and rules are _immutable_ and
although implementing only parts of `Scrum` is possible, _the result
is not_ `Scrum`.

<!-- Note -->
This is a direct quote from [the Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html), 2016 edition.
To be fair, the wording has changed since and the 2020 version no longer includes this precise wording, its [end note](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#end-note) still says substantially the same thing.

> The Scrum framework, as outlined herein, is immutable. While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum.

Okay, so we've now established that Scrum is all-or-nothing.
You can either do Scrum in its entirety, or failing that, you are not doing it at all.

As we'll see, this means that we can't just talk about whether Scrum is a good idea to do — it isn't — but rather whether it is *possible* to do Scrum at all.

So what does Scrum postulate?


Teams self-manage

<!-- Note -->
A central notion is that teams self-manage.

Now, I am absolutely not one to argue that this part is impossible.
Teams of professionals are certainly capable of self-management.

*If,* that is, a critical prerequisite is met, namely:


Teams self-manage

_if they are stable._

<!-- Note -->
That the team is stable.
Team success, and this is something that the applicable science is pretty clear about, is determined to a much greater degree by team stability rather than by individual contributor brilliance.

And team stability is practically never a given in the software industry.
As soon as a person leaves or joins a team, *there is a new team,* and we are a competitive, growth-oriented industry.
Someone new joining the team, or leaving to pursue something else, is relatively normal.

And then the onus is on people we call "managers" — I am one such creature — to find the right people, and ensure that they integrate well, and that everyone can collaborate with them productively.

To say "oh the team manages itself" is just shirking management responsibility.


Sprint after sprint after sprint.

<!-- Note -->
The Scrum Guide states, unambiguously:

> A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

That's not how sprinting works. That's not how anything works.


Sprint after sprint after sprint.

_Try that in a marathon._

<!-- Note -->
If this did work, then the current world record for the marathon would be 1 hour, 7 minutes, and 22 seconds, because of course a marathon is just 422 100m dashes, no?
So what's the big deal with Kipchoge breaking two hours, eh?
The slacker. He'd never last in a Scrum team!

This is nonsense.
Software development is a marathon, not a sprint.
And pretending otherwise is just herding people into burnout.


Daily scrum.

<!-- Note -->
Up next: the daily scrum.
The Scrum Guide [defines this event](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum) as a specific, daily occurrence, time-boxed to 15 minutes and involving the entirety of the development team.

Now it should give you pause that this is named after an event in rugby, for which professional players had to invent [a safeword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeword_(sports)) so they wouldn't get their necks broken.

But even if you disregard the original meaning entirely: 


Daily scrum.

_What planet do you live on?_

<!-- Note -->
On what kind of planet does this make sense?

This is staggeringly out of place in the modern development team, which may well be spread out over multiple homes or offices and timezones, and may not even physically be in one place more than a handful of times a year. 
Even in the unlikely event that everyone can get together in one room for precisely fifteen minutes each day, have you ever been in a meeting involving more than 3 people that got anything accomplished in 15 minutes?

And remember, 15 minutes. Time-boxed, immutable. If you think your Daily Scrum can be 30 or 45 minutes, or you can do it just every other day or maybe thrice a week, recall: if you do that, you’re no longer doing Scrum.

And there are a bunch of other traits of Scrum that make zero sense but I am short on time so these three will have to do.


Reasonable for emergencies.

<!-- Note -->
Arguably, some of the methods proposed in Scrum are suitable for emergency situations.
In a situation where you need to come up with a solution that requires creativity, hustle, and speed, you may well sit down, put down a requirements list, elect a coordinator and spokesperson for your team, and just start hacking.

I’d agree that such situations can be extremely challenging, and quite satisfying to come out of with flying colors.

But:


Reasonable for emergencies.

If your team is permanently in an emergency, _quit._

<!-- Note -->
If your organization is permanently operating in this mode, hightail it out of there.

It doesn’t matter which role you’re in: as a developer, you’re headed for burnout.
As a manager, you’re herding your team into burnout.

Either way, you shouldn’t be doing this job, either in your own interest or in that of others.


_Don't be a scrumbag._
